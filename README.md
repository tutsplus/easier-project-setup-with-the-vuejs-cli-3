# [Easier Project Setup With the Vue.js CLI 3][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Front-end coding has come a long way since JavaScript first appeared, but more sophisticated frameworks and tools means that setting up a project or development environment can be tedious and time consuming. But if you use Vue.js, the Vue CLI can get you up and developing with little to no configuration. Huzzah! 

In this course, Jeremy McPeak will show you how to use the Vue CLI to create and configure your Vue projects. You'll learn some of the key options for a new project, how to add new pages, how to work with assets, and how to use Node.js environment variables. And finally, you'll learn how to build your app for deployment.
